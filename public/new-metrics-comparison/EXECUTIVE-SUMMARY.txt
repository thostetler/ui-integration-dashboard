# Performance Analysis: Executive Summary (1 Page)

**Period:** January 2025 vs November 2025  
**Analysis Date:** November 6, 2025 (19:20 UTC)  
**Confidence:** Very High (140-172 samples per metric, 95% CI)

---

## 📊 THE SCORE

| Category | Result | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **Major Improvements** | 31 findings | ✅ Wins |
| **Regressions** | 6 findings | ⚠️ Issues |
| **Minor Improvements** | 19 findings | ✅ Good |
| **Unchanged** | 40 findings | ➡️ Stable |

---

## ✅ THE BIG WIN: Backend 45% Faster

**TTFB (Time to First Byte)** improved by **-45%**
- Before: 151ms average
- After: 83ms average
- Status: **Stable across all tests**
- Recommendation: **Preserve this optimization**

💡 **What this means:** Users get data faster. This is a legitimate performance improvement.

---

## ⚠️ THE CRITICAL ISSUE: First Paint 30% Slower (on Average)

**FCP (First Contentful Paint)** degraded by **+30% average**

**Affected:** All 6 query types (100% of tested scenarios)

| Query Type | Degradation | Severity |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| first-author | +41% | 🔴 Worst |
| abstract-keyword | +36% | 🔴 Worst |
| title-keyword | +35% | 🔴 Worst |
| bibcode-search | +26% | 🟠 Bad |
| and-search | +25% | 🟠 Bad |
| citations | +18% | 🟡 Moderate |

💡 **What this means:** Users see content slower. This hurts perceived performance.

## 🔍 WHAT HAPPENED

### Rendering Code Changed
- All query types affected equally
- Not a data issue, not a query issue
- **Likely cause:** Framework-level rendering change

### Backend Code Improved
- All tests faster
- Consistent across conditions
- Clear win from code optimization

### Status
- One good, one bad
- Need code investigation to understand why

---

## 🎯 ACTION REQUIRED

### Immediate (This Week)
```
Priority: 🔴 URGENT
Action:   Review rendering code changes (Jan→Nov)
Owner:    Engineering Lead
Impact:   Users experience 18-41% slower page loads
Deadline: Identify root cause
```

### Next Steps
1. Compare rendering code between Jan and Nov
2. Look for: React changes, CSS-in-JS changes, suspense boundaries
3. Profile why some queries are slower than others
4. Implement fix to recover FCP performance

### Keep
1. Preserve the -45% TTFB optimization
2. Document what was changed so it stays
3. Add performance regression tests

---

## 💭 THE BOTTOM LINE

### Good News
- Backend optimization delivered -45% improvement ✅
- This is a major win worth keeping
- Multiple other metrics improved

### Bad News
- Frontend rendering broke
- Users see pages 18-41% slower to render
- All query types affected (systematic issue)

### Next Move
**Investigate rendering code changes to fix FCP while preserving TTFB gains.**
